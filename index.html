        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          All slides or scripts of the computer science studies up to the 4th
          semester were analyzed (and a few slides of the 5th semester).
          Furthermore, an embedding vector was created for each page/slide. This
          vector represents the semantic meaning. Since this vector has a
          dimension of 1536, TSNE (T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)
          was used to reduce the dimension to 2 to represent it graphically.
          <br /><br />To explore the dataset, you can choose between the views
          Pages, Documents and Courses. Using the tooltip, you can see
          additional information about this data point.<br /><br /><br />
        </p>
        <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
        <p>
          No guarantee of correctness or completeness of the data. In addition,
          a reduction of the dimensions using TSNE does not guarantee a correct
          representation of the relationships. Since the original dimension was
          much larger than 2, data points may overlap that have nothing to do
          with each other.<br />
          Please don't try to learn from this horrible code. It had to be done quickly.
